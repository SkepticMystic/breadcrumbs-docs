This command rebuilds the [[Reference#Graph|Breadcrumbs graph]]. This is useful if you've made changes to your notes, and want to see them reflected in the graph.

## Rebuild Graph Settings

- **Notify on Rebuild**: Show a notification when the graph is rebuilt. The notification will show a summary of any errors that occurred during the rebuild.
- **Triggers**: Choose to automatically run the command when you change notes, or when you save a note.

The _edge builders_ add edges to the [[Concepts#Graph|Breadcrumbs graph]] using the various sources of structure that already exist in your notes/vault. Some are relatively manual, like [[Typed Links]], while others are more flexible and automated, like [[Date Notes]].

> [!TIP]
> Any edge added by one of these edge builders is referred to as "_explicit_", because it came from existing structure in your vault (e.g. tags, folders, links, dates, etc.). In contrast, "_[[Implied Edge Builders|implied]]_" edges are _not_ explicitly defined in your notes' metadata, but can be deduced _from your explicit edges_, based on the [[Transitive Implied Relations]] rules you've added in your settings

The different edge builders include:

- [[Typed Links]]
- [[Tag Notes]]
- [[Regex Notes]]
- [[List Notes]]
- [[Dendron Notes]]
- [[Johnny Decimal Notes]]
- [[Dataview Notes]]
- [[Date Notes]]
- [[Folder Notes]]

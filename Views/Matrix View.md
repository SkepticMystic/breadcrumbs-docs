The _Matrix View_ appears on the side of the editor, and shows the **immediate neighbours** of the current note (in all 5 directions).

On the right side of each link, you'll see an `x` or `i`, indicating if that edge is [[Explicit Edges|explicit]] or [[Implied Edges|implied]]. Hover over the icon to see the _source_ of real edges, and the _kind_ of implied edges (as well as the [[Implied Relation Rounds|round]] they were added in).

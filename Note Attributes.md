The following metadata fields influence how Breadcrumbs adds edges to the graph. They can be added to the YAML frontmatter of a note, or as an inline Dataview field.

- `BC-ignore-in-edges: true`: Don't add edges coming _into_ this note.
- `BC-ignore-out-edges: true`: Don't add edges going _out of_ this note.

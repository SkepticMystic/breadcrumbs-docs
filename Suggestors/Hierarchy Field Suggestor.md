The Hierarchy Field Suggestor lets you quickly add a new [[Typed Links|typed-link]] edge. If you type the _trigger_ string at the start of a line, it will show you a list of all the fields you've used in your Breadcrumbs hierarchies, and let you quickly select one.

## Settings

- **Enable**: Enable the Hierarchy Field Suggestor. Obsidian needs to be restarted after enabling.
- **Trigger**: The character(s) that triggers the suggestor. Defaults to `.`.

_Field Groups_ are simply a convenience to work with multiple [[Edge Fields|edge fields]] at once.

In Settings > Edge Fields, you can create new groups and add fields to them. This is a many-to-many relationship, i.e. a group can hold many fields, and a field can belong to many groups.

The groups are mainly used in the [[Views]], to decide which fields are included.

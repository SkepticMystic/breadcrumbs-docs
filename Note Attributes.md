The following metadata fields influence how Breadcrumbs adds edges to the graph. They can be added to the YAML frontmatter, or as an inline Dataview field.

- `BC-ignore-in-edges`: If true, Breadcrumbs won't add edges coming _into_ this note.
- `BC-ignore-out-edges`: If true, Breadcrumbs won't add edges going _out_ of this note.

Hi there, everyone 🙂

I've been working hard on rebuilding **Breadcrumbs** 🍞 from scratch, and I'm happy to say that many long-standing issues are now resolved, and most functionality has been reintroduced. You can read this note for more info on the changes: <https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/blob/master/V4.md>

V4 is still in beta, and only accessible via the BRAT plugin. If you're an **existing** Breadcrumbs user, make sure you understand what's different by reading the link above, and checking the latest issues on the repo (with "V4" in their name). But for the most part, backwards-compatibility has been preserved. If you're **new** to Breadcrumbs, there's never been a better time to get started! The README has been rewritten, so everything is in one place and up to date.

As always, let me know if you've got any questions, or run into any issues. You can join our discussion at <#929513881041248266>.

Thanks to everyone who has helped beta test so far 💚

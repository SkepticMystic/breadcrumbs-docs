The Edge Field Suggester lets you quickly add a new [[Typed Links|typed-link]]. It opens when you type the "_trigger string_" at the start of a line, it will then show you a list of all your [[Edge Fields]], and let you quickly select one.

> [!NOTE]
> This only applies to [[Typed Links#Dataview Links|Dataview typed-links]]. For [[Typed Links#Frontmatter Links|Frontmatter typed-links]], all of your [[Edge Fields]] are automatically added as [Obsidian Properties](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties), so you get that auto-complete "for free" (in the same way as the [[Metadata Field Suggester]] works).

## Settings

- **Enable**: Enable the suggestor. Obsidian needs to be restarted after enabling.
- **Trigger**: The character(s) that triggers the suggestor. Defaults to "`.`" (a period).

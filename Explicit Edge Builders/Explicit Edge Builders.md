The _explicit edge builders_ are the various ways of adding edges to the Breadcrumbs graph. Some are more manual, while others automatically leverage the existing structure in your notes.

> [!TIP]
> They are referred to as "_explicit_" because they're derived from the explicit structure in your notes/vault. Whereas the [[Implied Edge Builders]] _build off of other explicit edges_.

The different explicit edge builders include:

- [[Typed Links]]
- [[Tag Notes]]
- [[Regex Notes]]
- [[List Notes]]
- [[Dendron Notes]]
- [[Johnny Decimal Notes]]
- [[Dataview Notes]]
- [[Date Notes]]
- [[Folder Notes]]

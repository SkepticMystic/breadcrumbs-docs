- `[Markdown](links)` are now detected, without any changes needed 🔗
- "Stretch to Existing" option on Date Notes to skip any missing daily notes 📆
- The Johnny Decimal naming system is now a supported Edge Builder! `100.10.a`
- Debugging log levels have been re-implemented 🔇
- The Threading command has been re-implemented 🧵

The README currently serves as the full documentation, so detailed info about the above is available there: https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs. As always, let me know if you've got any questions in <#929513881041248266>. Thank you to everyone who helped suggest/test these new changes 💚

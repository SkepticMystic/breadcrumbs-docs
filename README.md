### Current TODOs

If you want to quickly jump in and help, here are some bigger things that need doing:

- [ ] Convert mermaid.live embedded charts to Mermaid codeblocks
- [~] Add more images, especially for the [Views](Views/Views.md) section

Other than that, you can search for "TODO" in the notes to find smaller things to do.

Breadcrumbs lets you choose a _log level_ in the settings, to determine which console logs you want to be shown, and which to hide

## Log Levels

In increasing order of importance:

- **DEBUG**: In-depth logs
- **INFO**: Not critical, but fewer than DEBUG
- **WARN**: Notifies of problems that can be recovered from
- **ERROR**: Unrecoverable errors
- **FEAT**: Some features exist specifically to log to the console (e.g. the [[Graph Stats|graph stats command]])

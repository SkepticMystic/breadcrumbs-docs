The Trail View shows all paths going _up_ from the current note.

## Settings

- **Enable**: Show/hide the Trail View at the top of your notes.
- **Format**: Show the results in a Path/Grid format (the underlying data is still the same).
- **Path Selection**: Show all paths, or only the shortest/longest path.
- **Depth**: A maximum _depth_ of the paths. If the paths go longer than the max depth, slice them off.
- **Show Controls**: Show/hide a set of controls on top of the Trail View to change the above options.
- **No Path Message**: The message to show when there are no paths to show. Leave blank to show nothing.

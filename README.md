### Current TODOs

If you want to quickly jump in and help, here are some bigger things that need doing:

- [ ] Add more images, especially for the [Views](Views/Views.md) section
- [ ] Add appropriate `next:: [[note]]` fields to each note

Other than that, you can search for "TODO" in the notes to find smaller things to do.

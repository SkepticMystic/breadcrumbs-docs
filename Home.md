Welcome to the Breadcrumbs docs üçû Here you can find more detailed explanations of the various functions of the Obsidian [Breadcrumbs plugin](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs).

Breadcrumbs lets you add _directed edges_ to your Obsidian notes. You supply the structure, Breadcrumbs helps you leverage it.

## Quick Start

- Open a new note
- Add `up: [[another note]]` as a Properties field
- Run the "**Breadcrumbs: Rebuild Graph**" command
- Then run the "**Breadcrumbs: Open Matrix View**" command
- See how Breadcrumbs points _up_ to `[[another note]]`

In the terminology of Breadcrumbs, you've just used the "[[Typed Links|typed-link]]" edge builder to add an [[Explicit Edges|explicit edge]] from one note to another, using the `up` [[Hierarchies|hierarchy field]].

## Overview

- Setup your [[Hierarchies]]
- Add structure to your notes using the various [[Explicit Edges|Explicit Edge Builders]]
  - The [[Hierarchy Field Suggestor]] can speed things up
- Fill in the gaps with the [[Implied Edges|Implied Edge Builders]]
- Use the [[Views|Views]] to see your hierarchy in action
- Try out the [[Commands|Commands]] to do other useful stuff
